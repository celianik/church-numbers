# Church-Numbers
Codewars Katas on Church Numbers

Church Numbers are representations of natural numbers (non-negative integers) as functions. Not only as functions, but as functions that can perform a task upon a value a set number of times. This is an important concept of Lambda Calculus, so naturally we'll have to talk about Lambda Calculus.

Lambda Calculus is a syntax for functional computing/mathematics. In Lambda Calculus, a function has one input, and one output. However, the input function can be another lambda function (which accepts another input), and this can somewhat simulate multiple inputs with some important differences.
